# Fahrenheit Celcius Python Converter
Simple program with ability to convert Fahrenheit to Celcius or Celcius to Fahrenheit. Program features the use of try/except as well as ability to be rerun or shut down.

Is there any features you think should be added? Feel free to fork and add, I'm interested to see how others add to the program!
